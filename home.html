         When you picture a MacBook or a MacBook Air, you immediately think of a light-gray aluminum chassis with a backlit half-eaten Apple logo on the back. While most of Apple's notebooks retain the same old design, in 2015, the company finally stepped out of its comfort zone and gave us something different in the 12-inch MacBook with Retina display (2015). Available in space gray, gold or traditional silver, the anodized aluminum chassis weighs an astonishing 2 pounds, making it a full pound lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Air. The company even took the bold step of eliminating most of the ports, save for an audio jack and a USB Type-C port. That's just enough to put Apple back on the design radar.

            <p>         
On October 23, 2001, Apple introduced the iPod digital music player. Several updated models have since been introduced, and the iPod brand is now the market leader in portable music players by a significant margin. More than 350 million units have shipped as of September 2012.Apple has partnered with Nike to offer the Nike+iPod Sports Kit, enabling runners to synchronize and monitor their runs with iTunes and the Nike+ website.
At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated iPhone, a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007 for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract.On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory, in addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE cellular phone with features found in handheld devices, running scaled-down versions of Apple's Mac OS X (dubbed iPhone OS, later renamed iOS), with various Mac OS X applications such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather. The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and "g").
 On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, the iPad, which runs a modified version of iOS. It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch screen.It also includes a mobile version of Safari for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts, and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user's computer.AT&T was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.</br></br>

            <p>         
The Apple Watch smartwatch was launched by Cook on September 9, 2014, and released on April 24, 2015.The wearable device consists of fitness-tracking capabilities that are similar to Fitbit, and must be used in combination with an iPhone to work (only the iPhone 5, or later models, are compatible with the Apple Watch).
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the Apple TV (previously known as the iTV),a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p.On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model.A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Apple wants to start producing an electric car with autonomous driving as soon as 2020. Apple has made efforts to recruit battery development engineers and other electric automobile engineers from A123 Systems, LG Chem, Samsung Electronics, Panasonic, Toshiba, Johnson Controls and Tesla Motors.
